How to modify the site
---------------

The website has been built using [middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/)

* the base layout for all the pages (currently only the main page) is `source/layouts/main.erb`
* all the multi-language pages must be placed into the `source/localizable/` folder
* all the template fragments must be placed into the `source/partials/` folder and must follow middleman's naming conventions
* all the yaml language files must be placed into the `locales/` folder

How to add a blog post

in the blog/blarticles directory create a new .html.markdown file (or start from one of the existing files) and write the content using standard HTML
